6,The New York Times,4/8/2016,Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Bring Their Battle to Brooklyn,"In Brooklyn Heights, on the 11th floor of an office building, Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign headquarters was humming on Monday. Staff members and volunteers were working the phones in spacious offices with windows that look out on the Manhattan skyline. Photos of supporters, an array of campaign buttons and a hanging gong, with the names of states she has won scribbled onto it in marker, adorned the sleekly designed space. A retired New York police officer stood guard. Two miles away, in a gritty open-floor office space in Gowanus, Brooklyn, that smelled of fresh paint, an army of mostly young Bernie Sanders supporters began gathering two weeks ago to spread his message. Last weekend, they nibbled on orange slices, perched on plastic folding chairs and sifted through mountains of newly delivered cardboard boxes filled with Bernie for President pamphlets. Visitors walked up a driveway and through a half-open side door to enter. Brooklyn, where Mr. Sanders grew up and where Mrs. Clinton established her campaign headquarters a year ago, is the center of the next political contest: the New York Democratic primary on April 19. It is a crucial one in a race — and an election year — that has been full of surprises. The state has 291 delegates, including 247 pledged delegates up for grabs. (There are also 44 superdelegates.) Even with his recent wins in Washington, Alaska, Idaho, Utah, Hawaii and Wisconsin, Mr. Sanders would need an estimated 56 percent of the remaining pledged delegates nationwide to overtake Mrs. Clinton, who maintains a lead of 219. A win for Mr. Sanders in New York would not only buoy his candidacy, but it would also be an embarrassment to the former senator from New York. Of the three million people registered to vote as Democrats in New York City, about 945,600 live in Brooklyn, meaning the borough — the most populous in the city — is home to a significant portion of the 5.8 million Democrats registered across the state. Drawing even more attention to the borough, the two campaigns, after weeks of squabbling, have agreed to a televised debate between the candidates on April 14 to be held at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The styles, staffs and settings of the two campaigns are telling, both of the Democratic race and of Brooklyn itself, a rapidly changing amalgam of affluent Park Slope professionals, newly arrived Williamsburg hipsters, longtime owners of Fort Greene brownstones, diverse Caribbean-American residents of Crown Heights and members of tight-knit Orthodox Jewish communities in Borough Park. Million-dollar condominiums are rising next door to blocks of decaying public-housing complexes; shiny new coffee shops and high-priced gyms are appearing on formerly blighted streets. While most polls show Mrs. Clinton, 68, leading in New York, the contest is proving to be emblematic of the same issues that are driving the Democratic race nationally. Mr. Sanders, the 74-year-old senator of Vermont, where he has based his campaign headquarters, hopes to make gains among voters by arguing that he formed his core ideas about income inequality while growing up the son of a Polish immigrant in Brooklyn. Yet the location of his Brooklyn field office — a far leaner operation than Mrs. Clinton’s headquarters — in a gentrifying neighborhood serves as a vivid reminder that his base of support is likely to come from new residents of the borough, many of whom are unfamiliar with the Brooklyn of his boyhood but are eager to back a more left-leaning figure. Mrs. Clinton’s connections to Brooklyn are more recent, and with her two terms as a senator from New York, they run deep. She has backing from a long list of elected officials, including, somewhat recently, Mayor Bill de Blasio, and has a network of community leaders powering her get-out-the-vote efforts, as she has in many cities. She has already begun touring Brooklyn, visiting churches and making her case as a hometown politician. “She has all the advantage,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a longtime political operative who is not affiliated with either campaign, but who has worked with Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor; Eliot Spitzer, the former New York governor; and President Bill Clinton. “Bernie’s chances are tough. Could he win it? Yes. Is it likely? No.” Many others, including Sanders supporters, agree with Mr. Sheinkopf. But Mr. Sanders has proved through a virtual tie in Iowa and his surprising victory in Michigan that he can beat the odds. On Tuesday, Mr. Sanders won 57 percent of the vote in Wisconsin. In his victory speech, the senator said that with the momentum from his victory in that state, he had “an excellent chance to win New York.” Last Sunday, Mrs. Clinton’s advantage in the borough was on display at the Christian Cultural Center in East New York, one of the largest evangelical churches in the city, which claims over 37,000 members — one of three churches she visited that day. The church is regularly visited by political leaders, particularly during election season. The Rev. A. R. Bernard, the church’s pastor, introduced Mrs. Clinton, saying that he had known her for more than 20 years and that the country needed “someone in power who knows how to manage that delicate balance between maintaining order and stability and fighting for justice and equality.” “I would be so humbled and honored to earn your support,” Mrs. Clinton said, pledging to reform the criminal justice system and focus on police killings. After she spoke, Mr. Bernard added that the country was at “a crossroads, socially and politically.” Mr. Sanders is poised to spend about $2.5 million on advertising in New York City and surrounding areas, with a lot of that money going toward winning Brooklyn, said Tad Devine, his senior campaign strategist. Mr. Devine added that Mr. Sanders planned to make several visits around the borough and hold the kind of large rallies he has staged in other states. “It’s a big place, and it’s a really progressive area in New York, so there are great target voters,” Mr. Devine said of Brooklyn. “We are going to talk about his own unique New York experience, his upbringing, the values that he learned growing up there and how that has shaped him in the course of his public career.”"
7,The Wall Street Journal,4/8/2016,Bernie Sanders’s Supporters Press Hillary Clinton’s Superdelegates to Flip,"Below the surface of the Democratic campaign, Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders are waging a fierce battle over the party leaders who play an outsize role in picking the presidential nominee, the so-called superdelegates. Mr. Sanders and his backers are trying to cut into Mrs. Clinton’s large lead in pledged delegates by prying away some of her superdelegates. Rank-and-file Sanders activists have taken it upon themselves to assist, using social media, emails and phone calls in ways that have created a backlash among the very people Mr. Sanders is hoping to win over. A California superdelegate backing Mrs. Clinton, Bob Mulholland, wrote a letter to Mr. Sanders this week saying the outreach to superdelegates from Sanders voters has gotten offensive, including calls coming late at night. Other superdelegates said they have gotten unwanted calls at work from Sanders backers, or have seen their Facebook pages flooded with warnings of political repercussions for supporting Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Sanders is currently far behind among the superdelegates, most of whom get their convention votes by virtue of being elected officials and party leaders. At this point, a total of 469 superdelegates are backing Mrs. Clinton, and only 31 are supporting Mr. Sanders, according to an Associated Press tally. Another 214 have yet to express a preference. Overall, Mrs. Clinton leads the race by 1,749 delegates to Mr. Sanders’s 1,061. With candidates needing 2,383 delegates to clinch, superdelegates have considerable influence in picking the nominee by dint of their numbers and because they can change their preference at any time. Their outsize role results from efforts by the party to head off long-shot candidates and avoid such landslide defeats as Sen. George McGovern’s in 1972. enior Sanders strategist Tad Devine said Thursday that, independent of the campaign’s courtship of superdelegates, some Sanders enthusiasts have launched their own “spontaneous” effort to help the cause. “A lot of people are motivated to make the argument on behalf of Bernie,” Mr. Devine said. “We’re not encouraging them in that; we’re not organizing them,” he said, adding that “we’re not discouraging them except if we hear of someone pushing a little too hard.” One argument the Sanders campaign is making to Clinton supporters: Superdelegates in states that voted for Mr. Sanders should back his candidacy so that they are in sync with voters. Yet the Sanders campaign also said it intends to court superdelegates in states that Mrs. Clinton won. A Clinton adviser said the Sanders strategy suggests the campaign recognizes it can’t overtake her lead by any other means. “The fact that they are articulating a path that relies on trying to wrest away superdelegates that have previously committed to us shows what dire straits they’re in,” said Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon. Mrs. Clinton’s staff sends a regular email update to superdelegate supporters and arranges conference calls with senior aides. Having seen scores of superdelegates defect to then-Sen. Barack Obama’s campaign in 2008, Mrs. Clinton is eager to keep her superdelegates in the fold this time around. One pro-Clinton superdelegate said a recent email message from her campaign included the line “Feel the Math”—a play on the Sanders campaign’s signature phrase, “Feel the Bern,” and a message that she enjoys a lead that Mr. Sanders will be hard-pressed to overcome. Mr. Sanders recently tapped Paul Kirk, a former Democratic National Committee chairman, to help court superdelegates. So far, Mr. Kirk said he is targeting the group who are as yet publicly uncommitted. The overtures from grass-roots supporters are more freewheeling. Sen. Maria Cantwell is a pro-Clinton superdelegate from Washington, a state won by Mr. Sanders with 72% of the caucus voters. Her Facebook page is awash in comments from Sanders supporters asking her to abandon Mrs. Clinton for the Vermont senator. A recent post by Ms. Cantwell congratulating the University of Washington women’s basketball team for making the Final Four was greeted with comments from Sanders supporters skewering her for backing Ms. Clinton. “We are watching you, Sen. Maria Cantwell,” one person wrote. “Don’t even think about going against the majority and backing HRC [Hillary Rodham Clinton] when your state wants Bernie Sanders.” A Cantwell spokesman said she is backing Mrs. Clinton because of positions the former secretary of state has taken on issues that are helpful to the state economy. Peggy Schaffer is a superdelegate from Maine, a state also won by Mr. Sanders. A longtime Clinton supporter, she said she will back whichever candidate winds up with the most pledged delegates in the end. Ms. Schaffer said Sanders supporters have launched a full-court press in her state, using emails, phone calls, letters and tweets to get her to back Mr. Sanders. At times, it can be uncomfortable. As a state employee, Ms. Schaffer isn’t permitted to engage in political activities while on the job. But Mr. Sanders’s backers repeatedly have called her work phone and have sent letters to her office. She has asked them to stop, but some have persisted. “I wish some of them would tone it down a little,” she said. While she has been flooded with messages from Sanders supporters, Ms. Schaffer said she has heard from just one Clinton backer who urged her to “stick to her guns.”"
8,CNN,4/8/2016,Bernie Sanders' campaign manager: Hillary Clinton has 'resume for the job',"Bernie Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver said Friday that Hillary Clinton's resume qualifies her to be president but added that a person's job history is not the only factor in picking the next commander in chief. ""In a narrow sense, does she have the resume for the job? Yes,"" Weaver said when asked by CNN's John Berman and Kate Balduan on ""This Hour"" whether her resume made Clinton qualified. ""There's more than just a resume, there's judgment,"" he added. Weaver responded to criticism the Vermont senator has faced after he said Clinton was not qualified to be president. ""There are a number of substantive issues the secretary has taken positions on over the years, including supporting the war in Iraq, including taking money from big companies, that call into question whether she should be the Democratic nominee,"" Weaver told CNN. Sanders told NBC on Friday, ""I respect Hillary Clinton. We were colleagues in the Senate, and on her worst day, she would be an infinitely better president than either of the Republican candidates.""
Weaver did not apologize for the recent heightened rhetoric on the Democratic side and blamed it on the Clinton camp. ""What has been clear about this campaign is that Bernie Sanders has really set the agenda in terms of what the issues are, what the message is. But the Clinton campaign has set the tone,"" he said. Weaver cited a report by CNN's Jeff Zeleny in which a Clinton insider said the campaign's strategy in New York was going to be ""disqualify him, defeat him and reunify the party later."" ""Bernie Sanders is a son of Brooklyn. He will campaign like a Brooklynite,"" Weaver said. ""If they want to bring it on that level, we're going to certainly bring it back."" Clinton herself referenced the controversy at a campaign event in Buffalo, New York, Friday afternoon. ""You may have heard Senator Sanders say I am unqualified to be president,"" Clinton said to boos. ""Seriously, I have been called a lot of things over the years, but unqualified has not been one of them."" Clinton added that Sanders ""finally acknowledged that he doesn't really believe that"" and that the back-and-forth is ""all pretty silly."""
9,The New York Times,4/8/2016,Catholics Express Hope and Disappointment Over Pope’s Statement on Families,"Wedding invitations. Empty nesters. In vitro fertilization. Children of divorce. Pope Francis’ new 265-page manifesto, “Amoris Laetitia,” Latin for “The Joy of Love,” covers so much territory that it is going to take some time for Catholics to read and reflect on it. But they are already forming impressions. Many said they appreciated Francis’ approach of accepting families as they are, instead of insisting on some ideal of perfection. The language in the document left plenty of room for people to draw their own conclusions on the hot-button question of whether divorced and remarried Catholics can receive the sacrament of communion without having their first marriages annulled. Those who were hoping for the church to be more flexible found plenty of that in Francis’ missive. Those who were hoping for a reaffirmation of the church’s doctrine that marriage is permanent and indissoluble were also reassured by what they read. Amoris Laetitia is turning out to be a Rorschach test for Catholics. Gina Ryan of Fairfield, Conn., said she felt hopeful that Francis is working to make the church more relevant to American Catholics. Ms. Ryan, 74, said the church had been central to her life, but that she had wrestled with its positions on contraception and the rights of lesbians, gays, bisexual and transgender people. Ms. Ryan has been married three times — each ended in divorce and annulment. Her first husband, with whom she had three children, was gay and died of AIDS 15 years ago. “I feel that the marriage to my first husband and the father of my children is my only real marriage, even though he was gay,” she said. She said she felt that Francis went as far as he could in his statement. “I think doing this with such sensitive language was very wise. I think what it boils down to is relevance. Without change, I think that people are just going to give up going to church.” Archbishop Joseph E. Kurtz, of Louisville, Ky., is the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and a social worker who has been in parish ministry. “Every aspect of church ministry is going to be affected,” especially marriage preparation and support for couples once they are married, Archbishop Kurtz said in a telephone news conference. He said he expected that the exhortation would have an effect on how seminarians are trained to work with families. Archbishop Kurtz said he thought Pope Francis’ message to pastors was “don’t forget to see people as unique,” not simply as categories. “The teaching is not changing, he’s not giving new regulations or new rules, but he is giving a mind-set in which we see the person first,” the archbishop said. William Steinmetz, a divorced father of two children, said he had hoped for more from Francis. Specifically, he said, he wanted to hear that the church would “recognize families as they actually exist in all their variations.” Mr. Steinmetz, 46, grew up in Pennsylvania and served as an altar boy in his local parish. He said he began to fall away from the church after his parents divorced, but was deeply committed to a spiritual life. He has been living with another man in a civil partnership in São Paulo, Brazil, for more than 20 years, but said he did not feel very welcome in any Catholic parish. “When Francis became pope, I was very excited,” he said. “I had very high expectations, but I realize he wasn’t as open as I thought he was.” Marianne Duddy-Burke, executive director of DignityUSA, an organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Catholics, said in a statement: “Clearly, church officials, up to and including Pope Francis, still have little idea of the reality of L.G.B.T. people’s faith, lives, and family situations. This document continues to demonstrate a tragic ignorance. Many L.G.B.T. people and families have offered to share their experience with church officials, and often get a deaf ear.” The Rev. Paul Huesing is pastor of Old St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Chicago, and a member of the Paulist religious order. His congregation is ethnically diverse, with a lot of young families. For the last 35 years as a priest, he said, he has been using the approach Francis suggests in the document. He encourages people who have remarried outside the church to examine their own conscience regarding whether to take communion. “The notion is that there’s a prayerful, reflective process going on,” Father Huesing said. “It’s not just, ‘Oh I want to go to Communion again.’ You take the teachings to heart, and evaluate your marriage in light of those teachings, and make an informed decision.” He said that this approach was “very common” among priests, but that “it varies widely.”  “I think the Holy Father is affirming a very pastoral and loving attitude that every pastor should have,” Father Huesing said. Barbara Falls raised eight children, now all grown, in Old Town, Me., never used contraception and attends Mass every Sunday. She said she really appreciated the passages in the document that call the church to work harder at preventing couples from divorcing, because in her experience marriages can be saved. “I don’t care whether you’re liberal, conservative, Catholic or atheist, keeping families together is really important,” she said. Mrs. Falls, who considers herself an orthodox Catholic, says she thinks that Francis is “trying to get people back to the church, so he’s trying to make it like we’re inclusive.” But she said: “I don’t think people are interested in going. I don’t think it’s going to work.” She said she knows people who are divorced, use contraception or have had abortions, and they already go to church and take communion with little hesitation — so Francis’ effort to welcome them back is unlikely to make much difference. “If you want to go to church, you’ll go to church.”"
10,CNN,4/8/2016,Paris terror suspect Mohamed Abrini arrested in Belgium,"Is a terror suspect arrested Friday in Belgium the hat-wearing man seen in airport surveillance video moments before one of two deadly terror attacks in Brussels? That's what investigators are trying to determine after nabbing Mohamed Abrini in a police operation in the Anderlecht district of Brussels. Abrini has been tied to the terror attacks on Paris last November through surveillance video and DNA. Authorities now can question him about the Brussels airport bombing on March 22, part of the attacks that killed 32 people. Two bombers died at the airport. A third man wearing a hat is seen on video walking with them. Authorities said he fled. Investigators also are trying to determine whether a man arrested in a separate operation Friday was part of the second attack -- at a Brussels metro station -- an hour later. Osama Krayem -- also known as Naim al Hamed -- might be the second person ""present at the time of the attack at the Maelbeek subway station,"" Belgian federal prosecutor's spokesman Eric Van der Sypt said. Authorities have said Khalid El Bakraoui carried out the metro attack and Van der Sypt said that another person was seen with El Bakraoui before the subway blast. Van der Sypt said surveillance video from a mall shows the second person buying the bags used in the airport attack. Abrini, a 31-year-old Belgian-Moroccan, had been among Europe's most wanted and was considered ""armed and dangerous."" His arrest means that Belgian authorities now have at least two people, along with Salah Abdeslam, who have been directly tied to the attacks in Paris. Abrini was seen with Abdeslam at a gas station between Brussels and Paris two nights before the Paris massacre. His DNA and fingerprints were lifted from a vehicle used in the Paris attacks, spokesmen for the Belgian federal prosecutor said. ""For French investigators, this can be very big,"" said CNN's Nic Robertson. ""This gives you a much stronger position to be in to get to the truth ... to (track) other terrorists on the run down,"" Robertson said. ""And also to understand precisely what happened in Paris.""
But according to Peter Bergen, a leading terrorism expert and CNN analyst, Abrini's arrest puts pressure on Belgian authorities to find out information quickly. Days after Abdeslam was arrested, terrorists carried out twin attacks in Brussels. A senior counterterrorism official has said the 26-year-old was probably going to be part of an attack planned by the same ISIS cell. ""Hopefully, Belgian counterterrorism officials won't make the same mistake they made last time with Abdeslam,"" said Bergen, vice president of the New America public policy institute. ""They didn't ask him about what else was in the pipeline."" According to a European police cooperative known as ENFAST, video showed Abrini with Abdeslam on November 11, two days before the massacre in the French capital. The same Renault Clio that Abrini drove was used in those attacks, ENFAST reports. Abdeslam told authorities he drove a car of that same make and model to the Stade de France -- where suicide bombers detonated explosives outside a soccer game -- and abandoned it. He then wandered into the subway and allegedly ""contacted one person,"" that being Abrini, CNN's French affiliate BFMTV reported. Abrini has a criminal record of violent theft. He also had a younger brother killed while fighting for ISIS in 2014, and he was in Istanbul, Turkey, briefly last summer and possibly in Syria. Relatives have insisted Abrini was in Brussels the night of the Paris attacks. More than four months later, Belgian state broadcaster VRT reports Abrini was still in the Belgian capital -- playing a hands-on role in the terror attacks there. He is ""more than likely"" one of three men shown on surveillance video rolling luggage carts through Brussels airport, according to VRT. On Thursday, Belgian police released a series of surveillance images showing the third man leaving the airport in Zaventem, then heading west into the Brussels district of Schaerbeek, over the course of two hours following the bombings. Last month, two friends told CNN that Abrini was a regular customer at a cafe in Brussels called Les Beguines. They said he used to visit in the evenings for a drink, and described him as a tall, slim, quiet man who would keep to himself. The other identified person arrested, Krayem, has been described as ""very dangerous and probably armed"" in a bulletin circulated by French investigators to European security services hours after the Brussels attacks. A French source close to the investigation into ISIS' terror network in France and Belgium told CNN that European security agencies believe Hamed, or Krayem, had an operational role in the Brussels attack. Krayem was a resident of Malmo, Sweden, and was known to Swedish counterterrorism services and suspected to have joined ISIS in Syria, Magnus Ranstorp, a Swedish counterterrorism expert at the Swedish National Defense College, told CNN. Krayem posted images of himself from Syria with automatic weapons and the ISIS flag, Ranstorp said. The final post he made on Facebook from Syria was in January 2015, Ranstorp said. The French newspaper Le Monde reported last month that the 28-year-old's DNA was found at the apartment in Brussels' Schaerbeek district where the three airport attackers left from the morning of March 22.
