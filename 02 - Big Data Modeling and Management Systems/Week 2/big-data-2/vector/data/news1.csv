1,ABC News,4/8/2016,Bernie Sanders Explains Why Hillary Clinton Is Both Qualified and Unqualified to Be President,"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders explained in an interview with ABC News today how in the span of just a few days he suggested that his opponent, Hillary Clinton, was both qualified and unqualified to be president. “In a sense it’s both,” he told ABC News' Cecilia Vega while touring the neighborhood in Brooklyn where he grew up. Sanders questioned Clinton’s judgment on several key issues, including her vote in favor of the war in Iraq, what he called her “dependence” on super PACs and Wall Street money as well as her position on trade agreements like NAFTA.  “Is that person who has that kind of bad judgment qualified to be president of the United States?” Sanders asked. “Well, qualified is a broad word, but I think that judgment lapse suggests that, you know, she might not be the best president that we need.”Sanders added: “On the other hand, if you look at her resume, if you like, at her experience, this was a woman who kind of broke the mold as first lady, and I think a very good job in that respect.” Earlier today in an appearance on ABC’s “The View,” Sanders acknowledged that Clinton was “obviously” experienced enough to be president -- a departure from comments he made two days earlier at a campaign event in Pennsylvania, when he said: “She has been saying lately that she thinks that I am quote-unquote, not qualified to be president. Now, let me, let me just say in response to Secretary Clinton, I don’t believe that she is qualified.” Should she become the nominee, Sanders told Vega that he would do “everything” possible to make sure a candidate from the other side of the aisle doesn’t end up in the White House. “It would be a disaster for this country to have a Donald Trump or some other right-wing Republican in the White House,” Sanders said. The Vermont senator pledged at the outset of his campaign to stay positive. But both he and Clinton have been skirmishing with increasing frequency and intensity ahead of the April 19 New York primary. When asked by Vega if he has any regrets, Sanders said with a laugh, “It’s hard to remember. I’ve said a million things.” He added, “You know, I’m sure that I have, but there’s nothing that particularly comes to mind at this moment.”"
2,Los Angeles Times,4/8/2016,"Trump, Clinton lead the pack in California, new Field Poll shows","With just two months to go before the California’s June 7 presidential primary election, New York billionaire Donald Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lead their respective party rivals in the state, according to a new Field Poll. The survey found that Trump leads Texas Sen. Ted Cruz by 39% to 32% among likely Republican voters. Ohio Gov. John Kasich came in a distant third with 18% support. In a January Field Poll conducted before the GOP field was winnowed to three candidates, Cruz had a slight lead over Trump in California, 25% to 23%. Among likely voters in the state’s Democratic primary, Clinton leads Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 47% to 41%, the poll found. Clinton’s support has held at that level since October, while Sanders has been on the rise. In October, just 35% of likely primary voters backed him. The polled showed that Trump had strong support -- 54% -- from Republicans who voted for Arnold Schwarzenegger for governor in 2003. Cruz appears to have strong support among Republicans in Los Angeles County. He leads Trump 40% to 29% among those voters. Despite topping the GOP field, Trump still has a serious image problem in the state. Among the likely California Republican voters surveyed, 43% said they had an unfavorable image of Trump, compared with 53% who said they view him favorably. Cruz isn’t that far behind: The poll found that 39% of likely GOP voters have an unfavorable image of him, with 54% viewing him favorably. Among likely voters in the Democratic primary, 27% said they see Clinton in an unfavorable, light compared with 70% with a favorable impression. Sanders was rated unfavorably by 16%, compared with 75% who view him favorably. The GOP holds a closed primary in California, so anyone who wants to cast a ballot for one of the party's three remaining presidential candidates must be a registered Republican. Democrats allow decline-to-state voters to participate in their presidential primary."
3,New York Times,4/8/2016,Bill Clinton Says He Regrets Showdown With Black Lives Matter Protesters,"Former President Bill Clinton said Friday that he regretted drowning out the chants of black protesters at a rally in Philadelphia the day before, when he issued an aggressive defense of his administration’s impact on black families. His reaction thrust a debate about the 1990s into the center of his wife’s presidential campaign, one that has focused heavily on issues of race and criminal justice. “I know those young people yesterday were just trying to get good television,” Mr. Clinton said Friday of the Black Lives Matter protesters who had accused him and Hillary Clinton of supporting policies that devastated black communities. “But that doesn’t mean that I was most effective in answering it.” His statement did not quiet a raging storm of criticism. Still, it was a remarkable reversal for Mr. Clinton, who occupies a singular role in his wife’s campaign as a spouse and a popular former president who can sometimes make himself into a lightning rod. He has had to campaign for his wife in an era when signature policies of his administration have been repudiated both by Mrs. Clinton and her opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. None of those issues has been more central to the 2016 campaign than the 1994 crime bill, which created tougher penalties for nonviolent drug offenders, erected dozens of new prisons, banned certain types of assault weapons and sent 100,000 more police officers to American cities. Today, Black Lives Matter protesters have pointed to the effects of that legislation as contributing to the high rates of incarceration of black men and the current tensions between police officers and black communities. Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders supported the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and have had to answer to Black Lives Matter protesters at their events. Both candidates will face tough questions on racial issues next week at the Rev. Al Sharpton’s National Action Network annual convention, less than a week before the April 19 New York primary. “I was painting crack houses saying, ‘Why isn’t anyone doing anything about it,’” Mr. Sharpton recalled of the 1990s. “But when that bill came out, we panicked because we felt it would go too far.” Indeed, most Democrats now believe that the bill, which many black leaders supported at the time, did go too far. At a convention of the N.A.A.C.P. last July, Mr. Clinton even conceded that the law he championed sent low-level criminals to prison “for way too long” and “made the problem worse.”  But on Thursday, when confronted with protesters over the issue, the former president refused to silently listen as a signature policy of his presidency was trampled upon. “I don’t know how you would characterize gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out on the street to murder other African-American children,” an animated Mr. Clinton said, waving a finger. “Maybe you thought they were good citizens. She didn’t,” he said of Mrs. Clinton. The video and accounts of his remarks ignited a fierce backlash and came as Mrs. Clinton seeks to solidify the support of black voters, who have voted for her overwhelmingly in primary contests across the South and Midwest. In her current campaign, Mrs. Clinton has been a fierce advocate of overhauling the criminal justice system, often campaigning alongside the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Sandra Bland and others who have lost children to gun violence or clashes with the police. Last April, as protests were consuming Baltimore and Ferguson, Mo., after the deaths of black men at the hands of police officers, Mrs. Clinton devoted her first major policy speech to overturning key parts of the bill. “It’s time to end the era of mass incarceration,” she said. On Sunday, she addressed three black churches in Brooklyn alongside Nicole Bell, the fiancée of Sean Bell, who was killed in a police shooting the morning of their wedding in 2006. In both of Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaigns, Mr. Clinton has proved both her best asset and an occasional liability. He remains widely popular and Mrs. Clinton often talks about his economic achievements. “When he was president, 23 million new jobs, incomes went up for everybody, not just folks at the top,” she said on Sunday. But other parts of Mr. Clinton’s record, including his support for global trade deals, deficit reduction and deregulation of Wall Street, have haunted Mrs. Clinton, as she confronts a challenge from the left. And Mr. Clinton has, at times, been an unpredictable and disruptive presence on the campaign trail. He infuriated blacks in 2008 when, after Senator Barack Obama appeared poised for a landslide victory in South Carolina, Mr. Clinton reminded the news media that Jesse Jackson had won the state’s Democratic primary twice. He also called Mr. Obama’s position against the Iraq war “the biggest fairy tale I’ve ever seen.” This time, Mr. Clinton has a close relationship with Mrs. Clinton’s senior campaign aides and has mostly remained dutifully on message, but the incident on Thursday served as a reminder that he remains a volatile force. His clash with black protesters on Thursday also underscored the drastically different political landscape Mrs. Clinton faces from the centrist wave that swept her husband to power. When Mr. Clinton ran for president in 1992, crack cocaine was ravaging American cities and the Willie Horton ad that the elder George Bush had used in 1988 to portray Michael Dukakis as soft on crime had wounded the Democratic Party. “You are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter,” Mr. Clinton said Thursday to protesters who held up signs that read “Clinton Crime Bill Destroyed Our Communities” and “Black Youth Are Not Super Predators,” a reference to a term used by Mrs. Clinton in 1996 to describe gang members and which she has said she regretted using. “Tell the truth,” Mr. Clinton told them. His reaction prompted wide criticism online. “Bill Clinton Reached Peak White Mansplain in a Face-Off Against Black Lives Matter Protesters,” read a headline in Jezebel. Salon called his response “cringe worthy.” 
“He just did to an entire generation what he did to Sister Souljah a generation ago,” Ben Jealous, a former president of the N.A.A.C.P. who is supporting Mr. Sanders, said in an interview, referring to Mr. Clinton’s forceful rebuttal of the activist and rapper in 1992 for remarks he deemed hateful. By Friday, Mr. Clinton said, “I almost want to apologize.” But Clinton allies said he should be putting into context his record and the landscape he confronted at the time. In 1993, violent crime had more than tripled in the previous three decades and law enforcement had not caught up. By the time Mr. Clinton left office, crime had dropped to a 25-year low and the homicide rate had declined by more than 40 percent, according to F.B.I. data. Median family income for African-Americans increased by 33 percent in the Clinton years, according to census data, a statistic he often cites when facing criticism of the 1996 overhaul of the welfare system. Representative James E. Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat and the highest-ranking African-American in Congress, voted for the 1994 crime bill. “There’s no question one of the biggest issues confronting the country at that time was the whole phenomenon of crack cocaine, which had precipitated tremendous anxiety through the African-American community,” Mr. Clyburn, who has endorsed Mrs. Clinton, said in an interview. But others say that the crime bill and the welfare overhaul, which cut federal spending on assistance for the poor by nearly $55 billion over six years, were done for political expediency at a time when the Democratic Party had lost five out of the last seven presidential campaigns and had to shift to the center to survive. “What Clinton did well was to stop the erosion of a certain class of Democratic voters who were fleeing to the Republicans,” said Nicholas Turner, president of the Vera Institute of Justice. “You can’t think about crime policy in this country at that time without thinking about the politics of it.” As for Mr. Clinton’s defense of the crime bill, Mr. Turner said, “I think the correct answer was simply, ‘I was wrong.’”"
4,CNN,4/8/2016,"TSA chief: More visible security, random checks outside airports","Transportation Security Administration Administrator Vice Adm. Peter Neffenger had just landed at the Brussels airport when suicide terrorists detonated bombs in the terminal last month. The attacks immediately set off a scramble by his agency to prevent the same from happening in the U.S., even as Neffenger, who was flying from Newark for meetings with aviation security European counterparts, spent hours trying to get out of the airport.
Now, U.S. authorities are increasing visible security patrols and random checks outside airports. The agency is also working to increase the use of bomb-sniffing dogs who roam public areas as a way to deter such attacks. And passengers can see some of the changes, Neffenger told CNN. ""They'll see a visible law enforcement presence in the public transit areas that will be local law enforcement, transit public safety, more explosive-sniffing dogs moving around, perhaps more random checks of the people moving through, random checks of the bags they are carrying,"" Neffenger said in an interview with CNN. For years, much of aviation security has focused on improving databases to screen ticketed passengers, to prevent terrorists from sneaking a bomb onto an airliner. But in Brussels, the terrorists didn't bother buying airline tickets. They targeted areas in the terminal that are lightly protected -- the ultimate so-called soft targets -- to deadly effect. ""There are some tactical things you have do to after Brussels, that is, you have to recognize that public areas of the world are vulnerable by definition,"" Neffenger said. ""And to the extent we can, we know the public areas of airports and transit systems provide at times attractive targets, so we've increased our presence ... and we've activated a lot of that over the last couple of years anyhow.""
Neffenger said security in public areas outside the security screening stations has always been a concern. Some airports such as Los Angeles conduct random checks of cars entering the airport, pulling over taxis to check for bombs. For the TSA, the challenge is that the agency doesn't control security checks away handled by local airport police. Nine months on the job, Neffenger says the TSA is also working to improve how it screens passengers and secures areas behind the security checkpoints. An inspector general report last year found glaring screening problems. And then there are headline-grabbing episodes, such as airport workers who allegedly were part of a gun smuggling operation at Atlanta's sprawling airport. The agency is boosting the frequency of criminal background checks for airport workers who have secured badge access to sensitive areas near aircraft. The idea, Neffenger said, is to bring the perimeter of security closer to the aircraft to reduce the so-called insider threat. That effort has taken on greater importance in the wake of an apparent terrorist bombing of a Russian airliner, which allegedly was aided by someone working at the airport. The agency is also working to deploy more dogs to screen for explosives. Neffenger says they're among the most effective ways to sniff out potential bombs. The dogs are being used to screen passengers who haven't signed up for the TSA's pre-check system, which allows passengers expedited screening if they submit to more intrusive background checks ahead of time."
5,The Wall Street Journal,4/8/2016,Bernie Sanders Will Visit the Vatican,"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders will visit the Vatican next week to discuss themes of economic and social justice that are the centerpiece of his campaign. The Vermont senator said Friday that he would participate in an April 15 conference on social, economic and environmental issues at a Vatican academic organization, stepping off the campaign trail during the crucial last days before the New York primary. Mr. Sanders said he was “moved” by the invitation and said he deeply admired Pope Francis, whom he isn’t expected to meet with on the trip. In an MSNBC interview Friday morning, he praised the pope’s efforts to “inject a sense of morality into how we do economics.” The pope has called for actions to address income inequality and has criticized American-style capitalism. The trip was announced as Mr. Sanders is looking to move past a tussle with his chief rival for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton, whom he denigrated this past week as “unqualified” for the presidency. He dialed back on those remarks Friday morning, saying “of course” Mrs. Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state, was qualified to be commander in chief. “On her worst day she would be an infinitely better president than either of the Republican candidates,” Mr. Sanders said on NBC, adding that the two Democratic candidates should focus on the issues instead of leveling personal attacks. Mrs. Clinton, asked Friday in Buffalo, N.Y., if Mr. Sanders was qualified to be president, affirmed that he was. “As I said, I would take him over Donald Trump and Ted Cruz any day,” she said. Mr. Sanders’s visit to the Vatican could carry a political benefit, coming just days before the primary in heavily Catholic New York. About 30% of the state’s adult population is Catholic, according to the Pew Research Center, versus about 20% of Americans overall. “I am a big, big fan of the pope,” Mr. Sanders said on MSNBC on Friday. “Obviously, there are areas where we disagree—on women’s rights or gay rights.” The contest in New York also has extra resonance for both candidates: Mrs. Clinton represented the state in the Senate for eight years before serving in the Obama administration, while Mr. Sanders was born and raised in Brooklyn. Most polls show Mrs. Clinton with a lead in New York, and she has a sizable lead in convention delegates, although Mr. Sanders’s recent primary wins have tightened that gap. Mr. Sanders is Jewish but hasn’t made religion a centerpiece of either his campaign or his political identity, speaking only occasionally about his background. “I am very proud of being Jewish, and that is an essential part of who I am as a human being,” he said at a Democratic debate earlier this year. The event at the Vatican will focus on creating an economy of “dignity, social justice and environmental sustainability,” the Sanders campaign said. Also listed on the program are Bolivian President Evo Morales and Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa. The announcement of the trip was briefly the subject of a dispute between two officials within the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, the organization hosting the event. On Friday morning, Margaret Archer, the organization’s president, told Bloomberg that Mr. Sanders had sought out the invitation to boost his campaign and accused him of a “monumental discourtesy.” The Sanders campaign said it never sought the invitation, an account confirmed by Bishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo, who is chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences. “The initiative did not come from the senator,” he said in an interview. “He was invited like all the other participants in the conference, in a letter from me as chancellor, writing in the name of the president.” Ms. Archer couldn’t be reached for comment. The Sanders event was announced on the same day that Pope Francis urged a more lenient approach to divorced Catholics, effectively encouraging clergy to grant some divorced people Holy Communion and opening a new phase in a long-running struggle within the church over its moral teaching. “By thinking that everything is black and white, we sometimes close off the way of grace and of growth,” the pope wrote in an apostolic exhortation titled “On Love in the Family.”"
